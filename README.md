# Introduction to Graph Theory

Graph algorithms. This library is used just for teaching purposes.

To visualize the graphs is necessary to import JUNG library to the project. (http://jung.sourceforge.net/download.html)

## Implemented Algorithms

### Search

- Depth first search (DFS)
- Breadth first search (BFS)

### Minimum Path

- Dijikstra
- Floyd-Warshall

### Minimal Spanning Tree
- Prim
- Kruskal

## Input

The input of the program is an adjacency matrix, such as:

0 1 1 0 1

1 0 0 0 1

1 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 1

1 1 0 1 0
