# GRAPH INTRODUCTION

Graph algorithms. This library is used just for teaching purposes.

To visualize the created graphs is necessary to import JUNG library. (http://jung.sourceforge.net/download.html)

## Implemented Algorithms

## Input

The input of the program is a adjacency matrix, such as:

0 1 1 0 1

1 0 0 0 1

1 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 1

1 1 0 1 0
